GetUsers.py - Python script I wrote to rotate guest passwords to 5 guest accounts being used in our district for logins to join Zoom meetings and what not. The passwords are then emailed to people at the site and select district contacts. In use, this script is scheduled to run on Friday afternoons to notify the sites of the next weeks passwords for the accounts.
